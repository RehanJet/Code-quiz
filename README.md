# Code-quiz

## Finished Summary

I wanted to make a website where someone can take a quiz to test there knowledge. This is a timed quiz where if you answer a question wrong you are penalized 10 seconds from the current time and when the time hit zero the quiz automatically ends.When the quiz is over you can also input your initails and save the score so you can take the quiz again to see if you can beat your original score. While making this site iI learned how to store data while also knowing and understanding how to use data direction to to see whats viewed or not veiwed on the webpage.

The following link takes you the Code quiz (https://rehanjet.github.io/Code-quiz/)
